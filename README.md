# Invisible Space

Forked from [atom-innerspace](https://github.com/squizlabs/atom-innerspace)

An atom package to show invisible characters between words and symbols, and within comments and strings.

Atom already has the ability to show leading and trailing whitespace characters, but not to display invisible characters throughout the rest of the line. Showing these characters makes it easier to do things like align code blocks and ensure you are adhering to coding standards.
